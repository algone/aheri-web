                    <p class="lead">Presently the demand for higher education in Africa far outweighs the spaces available in the higher education institutions. There are ongoing efforts to address this challenge by the individual national systems and institutions. However these efforts still fall short of the huge demand for higher education. The situation has resulted from the disproportionate increase of primary and secondary enrolment and completion rates compared to higher education development rates. Currently the higher education institutions have a capacity for about only 30% of students who qualify in Kenya. Further, Africa has the highest growth by enrolment rate of higher education compared to any other area of the world.
                    <p class="lead">The situation has been compounded by the fact that higher education both, as a field of study and profession is still new in the greater Africa higher education sector. It has not yet been fully incorporated as a profession in the planning and administration of higher education institutions within the target countries. While it has been in existence in the USA and Europe for almost 40 years (relatively new, compared to other fields of study) as field of study, it is none existent as a field of study in most African higher education systems, with the exception of South Africa. The unique context of the challenges facing the countries in the target region requires research on the circumstances with a view of developing local solutions. This will not only help in solving the present challenges in management of higher education but provides an opportunity for the higher education institutions to act as catalysts in solving other developmental challenges.</p>

                    <p class="lead">This initiative is motivated by the existence of similar institutes and centres within developed nations and the contributions towards development in those nations. A key element worth of note, is that all developed countries and the countries with emerging economies embraced research in higher education as a field of study and as a profession prior to their growth phases.</p>
